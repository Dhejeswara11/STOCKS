            <hr>
            <p>
                The <strong>Stock Management System</strong> is a web-based application developed using
                <strong>Python Django</strong>. It is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their inventory,
                track stock levels, manage suppliers and customers, and monitor sales and purchases in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This system provides a user-friendly interface, allowing administrators to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track inventory across multiple categories</li>
                <li>Manage supplier and customer information</li>
                <li>Generate reports for stock in/out activities</li>
                <li>Receive low-stock alerts and reorder notifications</li>
                <li>Ensure accurate inventory records and reduce human error</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our goal is to simplify inventory control and provide a scalable, reliable, and secure solution for businesses
                of all sizes.
